# angular-people-app (Angular 8 scaffold)

Minimal Angular 8 project scaffold with routing and SCSS.

Quick start

1. cd angular-people-app
2. npm install
3. npm start

This scaffold expects an API at /api/person for the person endpoints.

Node

### ⚠️ Important — Node version (read before installing)

> **Warning:** This project was scaffolded with Angular 8 and older CLI/tooling. It is known to fail with newer Node releases (Node 16+). Use Node.js 14.x (or 12.x) LTS when installing or running the app to avoid build or dependency errors.
>
> If you run into issues on newer Node versions, switch to Node 14 before running `npm install` and `npm start`.
>
> Example (using nvm):
>
> ```bash
> nvm install 14
> nvm use 14
> ```

This project works best with an older Node.js LTS release such as Node 14.x (or Node 12.x). Newer Node versions (Node 16+) can cause build or dependency errors with these older packages—if you run into issues, switch to Node 14 before running `npm install` and `npm start`.
